# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an earthquake map with three background maps and overlays using data from the United States Geological Survey's website (https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes). The data is updated every minute and can be obtained in various formats and time spans.

## Resources
* JavaScript  
* HTML
* CSS
* D3.js 
* Leaflet.js
* GeoJSON
* Mapbox
* Data Sources: .json and .html files

## Summary of Results
This project provided me with the opportunity to explore how maps can be used in visualizations within webpages and websites. In this case, we were tasked with showcasing three maps that were a backdrop to various earthquake and tectonic plate data within three overlays. In addition, pop up markers were added to provide the user with more relevant information then the legends could provide.

Overall, this challenge illustrates how frequent maps are used and not just for directions from point A to point B. Maps educate us on the world that exists outside our daily lives and provides us with a good reminder that humankind extends far beyond our doorstep.
